Shares retreated to an 18% gain at midday in London. Johnson Matthey has a 205-year history in Britain’s chemicals sector, but it has struggled in recent years. In November, it abandoned an effort to become a leading producer of batteries for electric vehicles, to the dismay of the UK automotive industry. The company’s roots go back to testing precious metals in 1817. It later became one of the world’s main suppliers to the automotive industry as rising awareness of pollution risks prompted the introduction of catalytic converters.

Institutions will often hold stock in bigger companies, and we expect to see insiders owning a noticeable percentage of the smaller ones. Companies that used to be publicly owned tend to have lower insider ownership. Johnson Matthey is a pretty big company. It has a market capitalization of UK£3.5b. Normally institutions would own a significant portion of a company this size. Taking a look at our data on the ownership groups (below), it seems that institutions own shares in the company. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner, to discover more about Johnson Matthey. Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. Johnson Matthey already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Johnson Matthey's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story."],"image":["https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1646538762520-2e1a73186d4e?ixid=MnwzMTg0OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwyfHxPd25lcnNoaXAlMjBTdHJ1Y3R1cmV8ZW58MHwwfHx8MTY1MTM3OTUzOQ&ixlib=rb-1.2.1"],"title":"What Is The Ownership Structure Like For Johnson Matthey Plc (LON:JMAT)?","description":"If you want to know who really controls Johnson Matthey Plc (LON:JMAT), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry.","publish":{"$date":"2022-04-18T07:59:10Z"},"createdAt":{"$date":"2022-05-06T12:58:33.91Z"},"updatedAt":{"$date":"2022-05-06T12:58:33.91Z"},"__v":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"626e1602cd287f48e273ac27"},"authors":["Reuters"],"content":["Shares in Johnson Matthey soared over 30% on Friday after the investment arm of New York-based industrial firm Standard Industries took a 5.23% stake in the British chemicals maker.

The stock soared after New York-based Standard Industries snapped up over 5 per cent of the FTSE 250 chemicals firm, which makes products including catalytic converters used in cars. The investment ignited rumours of a possible takeover, with broker Jefferies saying Standard Industries could be 'the ideal owner' for Johnson Matthey. Analysts noted that the US firm had a record of investing in chemicals globally and had purchased WR Grace & Co, a Maryland firm, for a 74 per cent premium last year.

Once its location and velocity are confirmed, a nearby special-purpose helicopter will take off toward its location.

Part of their allure is their flexibility to accommodate many types of lipids and precise control of the composition. However, little is known about how variations in lipid composition impact their structures and dynamics. Herein, we investigate how the introduction of the anionic lipid POPG into POPC NDs impacts these features. Small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS and SANS) of variable-composition NDs are complemented with molecular dynamics simulations to interrogate how increasing the concern of POPG impacts the ND shape, structure of the lipid core, and the dynamics of the popular membrane scaffold protein, MSP1D1(-).","A convenient benefit of including POPG is that it eliminates D2O-induced aggregation observed in pure POPC NDs, permitting studies by SANS at multiple contrasts. SAXS and SANS data could be globally fit to a stacked elliptical cylinder model as well as an extension of the model that accounts for membrane curvature. Fitting to both models supports that the introduction of POPG results in strongly elliptical NDs; however, MD simulations predict the curvature of the membrane, thereby supporting the use of the latter model. Trends in the model-independent parameters suggest that increases in POPG reduce the conformational heterogeneity of the MSP1D1(-), which is in agreement with MD simulations that show that the incorporation of sufficient POPG suppresses disengagement of the N-terminal helix from the lipid core.","These studies highlight novel structural changes in NDs in response to an anionic lipid and will inform the interpretation of future structural studies of membrane proteins embedded in NDs of mixed lipid composition."],"image":["https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1639946183218-3a537f6ff8d2?ixid=MnwzMTg0OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw2fHxEeW5hbWljc3xlbnwwfDB8fHwxNjUxMzY1NzIy&ixlib=rb-1.2.1"],"title":"[ASAP] Structures and Dynamics of Anionic Lipoprotein Nanodiscs","description":"Nanolipoprotein particles known as nanodiscs (NDs) have emerged as versatile and powerful tools for the stabilization of membrane proteins permitting a plethora of structural and biophysical studies.","publish":{"$date":"2022-04-08T04:00:00Z"},"createdAt":{"$date":"2022-05-06T12:58:33.968Z"},"updatedAt":{"$date":"2022-05-06T12:58:33.968Z"},"__v":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"626e32db605fe11e82e4e9e7"},"authors":["trevor.moraes@utoronto.ca (Christine Chieh-Lin Lai), trevor.moraes@utoronto.ca (Maciej Jagielnicki), trevor.moraes@utoronto.ca (Minh Sang Huynh), trevor.moraes@utoronto.ca (Trevor F Moraes), trevor.moraes@utoronto.ca (Yogesh Hooda), trevor.moraes@utoronto.ca (Yuzi Raina Li)"],"content":["Surface lipoproteins (SLPs) are peripherally attached to the outer leaflet of the outer membrane in many Gram-negative bacteria, playing significant roles in nutrient acquisition and immune evasion in the host.","While the factors that are involved in the synthesis and delivery of SLPs in the inner membrane are well characterized, the molecular machinery required for the movement of SLPs to the surface are still not fully elucidated.

The changes paid dividends for the visitors, who scored the last five goals to break the shackles and take a 14-9 lead at the first break.

Three-time letterman and a two-time captain. He played in the Under Armour All-America Game. Smith was the Gatorade Player of the Year in Virginia. He collected 135 total tackles, 15 tackles for a loss, 6 sacks, and 9 forced fumbles as a Senior. He had an even bigger Junior season with 165 tackles, 30 tackles for a loss, 11 sacks, 5 forced fumbles, and even blocked 6 kicks. He was rated a five-star prospect by 247 and a four-star by Rivals and ESPN. He also played some basketball as a junior. The former Nittany Lion signed with Penn State out of high school and played in 13 games as a true freshman collecting only 14 tackles and 2 tackles for a loss on the year. Smith took over as a starter in the shortened 2020 COVID season and started all 9 games. He collected a total of 37 tackles with 8 tackles for a loss, two sacks, and an interception. Smith injured his lower right leg against Iowa but returned only missing a few plays. He signed a NIL deal with Roc Nation. Smith also wore Riddell's new prototype helmet for the 2021 season. Smith moved to play the weakside linebacker role in 2021 after playing the strong side in 2020. 2021 was his second full season as a starter, he started all 12 games. He finished the season with 81 total tackles, 9 tackles for a loss, 2 sacks, 1 forced fumble, and 5 pass breakups. Smith declared for the draft with eligibility remaining. He also opted out of the Outback bowl.","Smith is an elite-level athlete and it shows on the field, he is fast and explosive. He also has good quickness with a solid backpedal. Smith's feet are always on the move; he does not stand still after the snap. Occasionally he will get physical with offensive linemen. He can easily defeat blocks from receivers using his strength and explosiveness. He has the speed and explosiveness to threaten the edge as a pass rusher. Smith shows good click and close technique explodes out of it. He has shown to have good cover skills for a college linebacker. The former Nittany Lion has shown on film he can carry a tight end up the seam. Smith has experience at both SAM and WILL spots. He's shown he can slip blocks. On film, he shows an ability to find the right gap and flow to the ball. There are times when he does play physically and you can see the potential. At times shows an ability to take on blockers and still effect or even tackle the runner with one arm.","His motor does run hot and cold from game to game. You don't necessarily see it from play to play through. He has a habit of trying to shoulder tackle and it doesn’t work. He missed 15 tackles on the year. Smith is inconsistent with how he takes on blockers sometimes he tries to take on blockers with his shoulder or avoid them which will take him out of the play. He has been an inconsistent hitter on film, more of a drag-down tackler. Plays with his pads high when dealing with linemen. he needs more strength. He has not shown he can stack and shed yet. Smith is inconsistent in finding the right gap to flow to the ball. He has trouble finding that balance between being aggressive but also being patient; sometimes he can be too aggressive and other times too patient. Smith has a habit of Looping around instead of pressing the line in the run game. He can be fooled by play action","Brandon Smith is an athletic freak of a linebacker with massive potential, but he hasn’t come close to reaching it. When watching his film, you are left wondering if he will. He has similarities to Oren Burks. He is already a good coverage linebacker for a guy as big as he is. His instincts just don’t seem to be there or they are a tick or two late. His technique still needs work; like his ability to stack and shed. he needs to bend his knees more to unlock his explosiveness. He can be a modern-day sideline to sideline linebacker who can play all three downs if he can hit his potential. At the very least he should be a good special teamer who can see snaps as a coverage linebacker. Fit with the Packers is going to depend on value. If they take him on day two expecting him to come in and be the WILL next to Campbell then they will be disappointed, but if they take him on day 3 with the intentions of using him on special teams and a #3 linebacker and seeing if they could develop him then he would be a great fit."],"image":["https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1552678038-1fb7bb8d29be?ixid=MnwzMTg0OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw4fHxCcmFuZG9uJTIwU21pdGglMjBORkx8ZW58MHwwfHx8MTY1MTM5MDE5OQ&ixlib=rb-1.2.1"],"title":"Brandon Smith NFL Draft Prospect Profile and Scouting Report","description":"Attended Louisa County High School in Louisa, Virginia.

It was a gritty performance from Memphis - the Grizzlies were outplayed for extended stretches of time against the talented Timberwolves. But the inexperience of Minnesota was not able to close the deal on a consistent basis, and the prior postseason scar tissue that Memphis had earned the previous two seasons came in to play as Ja Morant, Desmond Bane, and others finished off the Wolves across several 4th quarters.","Memphis, still one of the NBA’s youngest teams, took another major step for their franchise on Friday night. That progress is taking them smack in to the path of a familiar foe - both to the history of the Memphis Grizzlies during the Grit and Grind Era, as well as this next generation of bears from Beale Street.","The Golden State Warriors.","After a five game series win over the injured (but likely MVP Award back to back winner Nikola Jokic-led) Denver Nuggets, the Warriors appear to be back at full strength. Steph Curry and Draymond Green have returned to the starting lineup after injuries limited their regular season appearances, and Klay Thompson seems to be at least in the ball park of what he once was as a player in terms of impact, even if he is doing things a bit differently (less raw scoring, more facilitation - career lows in points per shot attempt paired with a career high in assist percentage). Add in Andrew Wiggins’ career year, veteran production off the bench from Otto Porter Jr. and impressive contributions from wings like Jordan Poole and Gary Payton II, and the Warriors are in as strong of a position to make a run at the NBA Finals as they were in 2019.","In fact, they did make (and lost) the Finals that year, and each of the last five times Golden State made the playoffs they got to the NBA Finals. Some things have changed of course - Kevin Durant and others aren’t around anymore, the Big Three of Curry/Thompson/Green are a few years older. But when the Warriors are in the playoffs, they expect a deep run. And Memphis, for the first time in some time, will be viewed as the underdog by many as this series begins.","The Warriors are the favorites in terms of betting at least - on DraftKings Golden State is -260 to take the series. The Grizzlies, however, were able to use their depth through the regular season to finish with a better record than Golden State, and therefore have home court advantage to start the series. It won’t be a lock to hold on to - the Warriors were 22-19 on the road this season and won a game in Denver, not an easy thing to do regardless of which players are healthy for the Nuggets. But it is an advantage nonetheless - having the home energy to latch on to to start a march up the Golden State mountain should be a major help."],"image":["https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1611534429435-f22970390b7f?ixid=MnwzMTg0OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw1fHxNZW1waGlzJTIwR3JpenpsaWVzfGVufDB8MHx8fDE2NTEzMjQ1NTk&ixlib=rb-1.2.1"],"title":"NBA Playoffs Preview Guide: Memphis Grizzlies vs. Golden State Warriors - The next step","description":"PROJECTED STARTING LINEUP: Ja Morant, Desmond Bane, Dillon Brooks, Jaren Jackson Jr.","publish":{"$date":"2022-04-30T19:27:12Z"},"createdAt":{"$date":"2022-05-06T12:58:34.056Z"},"updatedAt":{"$date":"2022-05-06T12:58:34.056Z"},"__v":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"626e39103647015e3e0c3052"},"authors":["CBSSports.com"],"content":["After the Grizzlies' Game 6 clincher over the Timberwolves on Friday, the second round of the 2022 NBA playoffs is set.

While there is an understandable level of disappointment, there is also a level of excitement that surrounds where this team can go. Few around the league expected Minnesota to actually have a chance to win a playoff series this year, and a big reason they were so close to doing so is Patrick Beverley. The veteran guard helped establish a new culture in Minnesota, and one that he revealed will expand even more this summer.","During his exit interview, Patrick Beverley revealed that he will be bringing young Timberwolves forward Jaden McDaniels to his summer workouts with Kawhi Leonard. McDaniels was arguably the team's 2nd best player in that Game 6 loss, as he kept them alive with his activity and three-point shooting. Beverley, who has maintained a relationship with his former LA Clippers teammate, says he wants McDaniels to see how those two go about their work.","While the Timberwolves should certainly feel as if they let this series get away, having double-digit leads in three of their four losses, there should also be a lot of optimism about the franchise's trajectory. After being so bad for so long, there is now reason to believe the Timberwolves will be in the playoff mix for years to come.

NASA should send a flagship mission to study the giant planet, says a new report from a panel of US planetary scientists. The agency almost always follows the panel’s advice.","The Uranus mission would be the first since Voyager 2 whizzed past the ice-cold body in 1986. The expedition could reveal how the planet, its rings and its moons formed and evolved over billions of years.","“This mission will be absolutely transformative,” says Amy Simon, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, who worked on the 19 April report, published by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in Washington DC. Uranus is full of scientific mysteries, such as why it rotates nearly on its side and how it developed a complex magnetic field. More broadly, studying Uranus could provide insights into planets orbiting other stars; of the more than 5,000 known exoplanets, the most common are around the size of Uranus.","Some planetary scientists have recently called for space agencies to send a major mission to Uranus or Neptune, which was also last visited by Voyager 2, in 1989. Both planets are ‘ice giants’, made up of large amounts of icy material swirling around a small rocky core. But Neptune did not make the cut in the report. “Uranus ranked higher because it is technologically achievable right now,” says Simon.","A Uranus mission could launch aboard a commercial Falcon Heavy rocket, a type of launch vehicle that is already operational. Launch could come as early as 2031, the first date by which a spacecraft could be designed and built, if it is fully funded. A mission to Neptune, which is farther from Earth than Uranus, would probably require a bigger rocket, such as NASA’s Space Launch System, which has not yet flown."],"image":["https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1572448181524-75f1370a806e?ixid=MnwzMTg0OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw2fHxzdG9wJTIwVXJhbnVzfGVufDB8MHx8fDE2NTE0MTQ2ODE&ixlib=rb-1.2.1"],"title":"Next stop, Uranus?

Amid a fevered atmosphere, which proved that the best female fighters can grip the attention of a sold-out crowd with riveting impact, Taylor received the verdict from two of the three judges to win a split decision.","Serrano, who fought with fire and ferocity, won the fight 96-94 on the first judge’s scorecard. The narrow margin seemed much more accurate than the assessment of the two officials who ruled in favour of Taylor by scores of 96-93 and an unacceptably wide 97-93. A draw seemed the right result to many at ringside because this was a fight that transcended the sustained hype and serious expectation which had defined the build-up. It was an exhilarating but brutal battle which left both women cut and bleeding and forced to call upon incredible reserves of courage and desire.","An electrifying atmosphere inside the Garden, with the Irish and the Puerto Rican fans swept away by a contest which deserved comparison with some of the most exalted fights held in this famous old arena, never flagged. Taylor and Serrano outstripped even that intensity in a bout of fluctuating fortunes and staggering intensity.","The first three rounds were close but Taylor’s corner had reiterated the need for a disciplined and measured performance and the champion, for the most part, stuck to the blueprint at the outset. Serrano hits harder and moves faster and she stalked Taylor resolutely without quite managing to close the distance. Taylor was concentrated and seemingly aware of the danger that she might get drawn into a toe-to-toe brawl. The 35-year-old from Bray is a better technical boxer than Serrano but, for all her intelligence and ringcraft, she is also a sucker for a good old tear-up.","But Taylor is smart, too, and she knew that this was a fight freighted with risk. She curbed her natural instincts to fire back. Instead she boxed crisply and frustrated Serrano, who would have benefitted from the rounds being three minutes long. Women’s boxing, however, still uses two-minute rounds which is simply not long enough when featuring fighters as skilled as these.","The fourth round marked a shift in the pattern as Serrano began to land punches more clinically. Suddenly, in round five, Taylor was badly hurt. Serrano punished her to the body and the head and blood ran down Taylor’s glazed face. She was backed against the ropes and seemed helpless to stem the onslaught. As she came out for the sixth it seemed barely feasible that she could survive as Serrano began throwing yet more baleful and heavy punches. A blankness spread across Taylor’s features as, rocked again, she clung on."],"image":["https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1570828984440-ebbcbdb1f71e?ixid=MnwzMTg0OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw5fHxLYXRpZSUyMFRheWxvcnxlbnwwfDB8fHwxNjUxNDE0MzI0&ixlib=rb-1.2.1"],"title":"Katie Taylor pushed to limit in split-decision win over Amanda Serrano","description":"Katie Taylor has retained her undisputed lightweight championship with a split-decision victory over Amanda Serrano at Madison Square Garden.","publish":{"$date":"2022-05-01T13:12:05Z"},"createdAt":{"$date":"2022-05-06T12:58:34.146Z"},"updatedAt":{"$date":"2022-05-06T12:58:34.146Z"},"__v":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"626e99215d18dc9b7705c679"},"authors":["The Irish Times"],"content":["She did it.

In Madison Square Garden. With the ghosts of Ali and Frazier and Joe Louis peeking down from the eaves to see what all the commotion was about. What they saw on Saturday night, they had seen before. Done before. Been before. Those days were gone, the days when boxing sucked the world to the Garden like a bathplug pulled from midtown Manhattan. Katie Taylor brought them back.","She did it. Twenty-one professional fights, 21 professional wins. The years are pawing at her now – she’s 36 in a few weeks. And so the victories that come these days, these nights, she has to pull harder on the rope to gather them in. Serrano probably deserved a draw on Saturday night – she surely didn’t deserve the 97-93 decision on one judge’s card. Boxing tends to bend towards its brightest lights though and Taylor got the call.","She did it. She took a sport that essentially didn’t exist when she started learning how to wrap her hands and look what she did with it. She made the case for putting it in the Olympics unanswerable. She brought the house down in London, just in case the IOC were wondering had they made the right decision. She gave amateur boxing momentum, a good news story to cut through all the corruption and judging and mess.","She did it. She changed how people thought about women in sport. In a very real way, she moved back the boundary rope of what people feel they can tolerate. Watch those final rounds on Saturday night, hair matted in blood, rivers of claret flowing between her and Serrano, splatter everywhere.

European destinations of Amsterdam (2), Rome (4), London (8) and Paris (9) also cracked the Top 10, with the American cities of Las Vegas and Miami also placing in the ranking.","As for why Asian countries likely saw a rise in their rankings while European ones fell, Carol Mueller, vice president of Berkshire Hathaway Travel Protection, told CNBC that priorities have changed since the COVID-19 pandemic, with terrorism and violent crime no longer ranking as top safety concerns. While still important, many respondents indicated that their top concerns were about whether or not they would have the freedom to move around a destination, be safe from contracting illnesses and risk of getting stuck in a country.","“It became a concern of... Okay, I’m going to travel. I’m vaccinated, I feel comfortable,” Mueller said. “But...what happens if I get stuck?”","Of course, where Americans may travel could come down to other factors as well, such as popularity and price.

It is the destination for lively tourism during the Thai New Year festival, from 7th-17th April 2022. Under the concept of Summer Vibrance and inspired by a fun lifestyle, experience the beauty of Isan nature and culture blended perfectly within an era of modernity and an atmosphere of creative experience that celebrates the uniqueness of the northeast.","Some of the highlights that represent the flavour of Isaan during the festivities start with the ‘Summer Spider Lawn’. Situated in front of the shopping centre, visitors can experience a Mekong River flow simulation surrounded by the decorations of ‘Thung’ – wind chimes made from cotton and silk threads bound together like a spider’s web, a symbol used by Isan people to repel negativity and also believed to bring eternal merit, beauty, peace and happiness. Central Embassy supports the local community by bringing and showcasing their outstanding cultural products woven by the villagers of the Kalasin province furthering links, career opportunities, and income generation for the community as a whole. ","Making your way to level 1 at the ‘Light the Way’ zone, find yourself dazzled by beautifully lit lanterns decorated in Thai fabric patterns lining the bridge that connects the Ploenchit BTS station to Central Embassy bringing brightness and colour and welcoming all visitors to the start of the festival of happiness and fun. ","On level 2, in support of Isaan community businesses, there are beautiful folk arts, cultural products, and Isan crafted decorations all from the northeastern region on display along the connecting tunnel of Central Embassy and the Central Chidlom Department Store. Named the ‘Vibrant Connection’, this event represents the movement and brightness of summer, ranging from indigo-dyed fabric products of Sakon Nakhon province to reed woven mats from Surin province – timeless traditional products that blend perfectly in today’s contemporary world. ","In addition to this, on levels 2-4 of Central Embassy, to provide opportunities and generate income for business operators within the tourism and hospitality industry, there is the Songkran Marketplace by TAT organized by the Tourism Authority of Thailand. At this event, we invite everyone to shop for premium tours, hotels and spa packages from entrepreneurs from all regions of the country with more than 60 booths providing high quality and standards from the Amazing Thailand Safety and Health Administration (SHA) at a special price.","To fulfill the joy of the festival on level 5, don’t forget to check out the ‘Summerful Market‘ zone where you can find a collection of Thai community cultural products, such as Thai fabrics, various ornaments and local food from more than 12 shops for customers to choose from. There is also the ‘Summer Vibe Activities’ zone, which holds activities for bathing the Buddha image for good fortune. If that isn’t enough, be sure to drop by to see a performance of contemporary Thai-Isan music on public holidays, Saturdays & Sundays and during the Songkran Festival on the 7th, 9th & 10th and from 13th – 17th April 2022 at 12:00 p.m., 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m., including the ‘Isan Palette’ zone with a Thung-making workshop every day throughout the event from 11:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. free of charge but with donations welcome with proceeds going to the Million Gift Million Smile Foundation. Also, for those interested in the local and wise art of weaving, join in the fun with a special workshop teaching Isan style weaving.

Netflix has quietly dropped Pearl, the working title of an animated series that was created by Meghan Markle through Archewell Productions, the shingle the Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry set up at Netflix in fall of 2020 to create scripted series, docuseries, documentaries, features and children’s programming. Pearl was to be Archewell’s first animated series.","Pearl, which Markle exec produced with David Furnish, was announced with fanfare last summer, described as a family series that centers on the adventures of a 12-year-old girl who finds inspiration in a variety of influential women throughout history. At the time Markle said, “Like many girls her age, our heroine Pearl is on a journey of self-discovery as she tries to overcome life’s daily challenges. I’m thrilled that Archewell Productions, partnered with the powerhouse platform of Netflix and these incredible producers, will together bring you this new animated series, which celebrates extraordinary women throughout history. David Furnish and I have been eager to bring this special series to light, and I am delighted we are able to announce it today.”","It is worth noting that the project was still in the development stage, and insiders at the streamer said there remains bullishness on the Archewell deal with a number of projects percolating, including the upcoming documentary series Heart of Invictus. And Markle has spent enough time in Hollywood as an actress to have heard the word “no” in the past.","Netflix scratched two other kids animated series last week that were in production — Dino Daycare from Ada Twist, Scientist executive producer Chris Nee, and the South Asian-inspired adventure Boons and Curses.","Word in town is that even before recent events, Netflix had been telling producers to take some development projects elsewhere, after those producers had been given indication they were priorities. Clearly, Netflix’s inordinately high content spend is being reevaluated. Many have felt that the Netflix “movie a week” mantra was an overreach, for instance. While Netflix felt pressure to generate originals to bolster its library as studios cut back on licensing titles as they started their own rival streaming services, there is reason that generating that much content has never been done before. It is just unreasonable to expect its execs to manage that many projects, and have enough of them turn out to be memorable. Expect the Netflix model to evolve; quality control and selectivity is actually a virtue for a mature streaming service."],"image":["https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1564413720987-d72e2ed6021a?ixid=MnwzMTg0OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxMHx8TWVnaGFufGVufDB8MHx8fDE2NTE1NTEwNjI&ixlib=rb-1.2.1"],"title":"Meghan Markle Series Pearl Canceled By Netflix; Archewell Ani Series","description":"Meghan Markle-Created Animated Series Pearl nixed by Netflix Meghan & Prince Harry's Archewell Productions first animated series.","publish":{"$date":"2022-05-02T20:10:35Z"},"createdAt":{"$date":"2022-05-06T12:58:34.197Z"},"updatedAt":{"$date":"2022-05-06T12:58:34.197Z"},"__v":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"6270ab91cb45d6dbf632c4bc"},"authors":["Showbiz Cheat Sheet"],"content":["Prince Harry and Meghan Markle still haven’t revealed whether they will be attending the queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations in June. One royal expert said the move is “manipulating” and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are “playing games” to keep attention focused on them.","While discussing how Harry and Meghan have yet to confirm their attendance at the queen’s event, royal biographer Angela Levin told TalkTV (via Express) she believes they are “manipulating” the situation.","“Harry’s said it was ‘security and everything else’ that’s stopping him,” Levin remarked. “What ‘everything else’ can it be? I hate people who manipulate like that. Ever manipulating, ever putting themselves at the front, and all about me.”","She continued, “What about the queen, for goodness’ sake? We now know she might not even be able to get onto the balcony.

People want to know what they’re doing, when are they coming — are they coming?”","Levin noted, “So they’re taking the focus away from the real royal family and actually playing games about, ‘will we, won’t we?’ And that’s very unkind — they must know if they can come. They have the money to come. The queen and the government have bent over backward to give them the security they want.”","She added, “But oh, no, they’ve got to play this game that they’re still not sure.”"],"image":["https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1526666361175-e3595627c376?ixid=MnwzMTg0OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw1fHxNZWdoYW58ZW58MHwwfHx8MTY1MTU1MTA2Mg&ixlib=rb-1.2.1"],"title":"Royal Expert Accuses Prince Harry and Meghan Markle of 'Playing Games' and Being Manipulative About Queen's Platinum Jubilee","description":"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are 'playing games' when it comes to whether they'll attend Queen Elizabeth's Platinum Jubilee, one expert says.","publish":{"$date":"2022-05-03T01:10:35Z"},"createdAt":{"$date":"2022-05-06T12:58:34.197Z"},"updatedAt":{"$date":"2022-05-06T12:58:34.197Z"},"__v":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"6270ab91cb45d6dbf632c4c2"},"authors":["MarketWatch"],"content":["Netflix has canceled development of a Markle-produced animated series in a cost-cutting measure amid disappointing subscriber numbers.","Netflix NFLX, +4.78% has canceled development of “Pearl,” an animated series from Meghan Markle, in the latest attempt at cost-cutting measures amid struggling subscriber numbers for the company.","According to a Sunday report from Deadline, several projects in development at Netflix were recently dropped by the service, including one the Duchess of Sussex’s “Pearl,” which was set to follow the life and adventures of a 12-year-old girl who finds inspiration in the lives of historically influential women.","“Like many girls her age, our heroine Pearl is on a journey of self-discovery as she tries to overcome life’s daily challenges,” Markle said when the show was announced in 2021.

Experts agree that it’s not the most accurate way to predict someone’s health status.","How accurate is BMI?","It is important to note that the formula used to calculate BMI is 160 years old, devised by Belgian mathematician and sociologist Lambert Adolphe Jacques Quetelet, and has been unchanged till date. “The reason why people stick to it is it’s easy to calculate and understand, and doesn’t cost anything,” shares Delhi based bariatric surgeon Dr Amitesh Pathak. However, he is quick to add that BMI excludes a lot of factors that are important for determining an individual’s health parameters. “BMI fails to take into account muscle mass, physical disability, bone density and much more, that contribute to giving a holistic picture of someone’s health,” he adds","Why is it flawed?","As BMI is dependent on only two criteria - height and weight - it tends to either overestimate or underestimate body fat in many individuals.

The research appears May 2nd in the journal Developmental Cell.","Even though it is well established that older men display reduced reproductive health, testis aging remains poorly understood at the molecular and genomic level. Moreover, it has not been clear whether lifestyle or environmental factors affect this decline.","\"Aging may confer a combination of modest molecular changes that sensitize the testis for additional dysregulation, with pronounced dysregulation caused when aging is combined with additional factors such as obesity,\" says co-senior author Bradley Cairns of the University of Utah School of Medicine.","To address this gap, Cairns and co-senior study author Jingtao Guo, also of the University of Utah School of Medicine, used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile more than 44,000 cells obtained from autopsy testis samples from four young men and eight older men. The older donors were screened for having offspring as young adults to ensure early-adult fertility.","The young samples clustered together and did not display molecular signatures of aging or a disrupted ability to produce sperm cells. Surprisingly, the older samples showed only modest age-related changes in stem cells that give rise to mature sperm, but were clearly classified into two distinct groups. The first group displayed an intact ability to produce sperm cells, with only weak molecular signatures that distinguished them from young samples. By contrast, the second group showed a very limited ability to develop sperm cells.","Notably, BMI emerged as a critical factor among older individuals. All donors from the first group had levels lower than 27, whereas all donors from the second group had levels higher than 30. Taken together, the results reveal possible molecular mechanisms underlying the complex testicular changes associated with aging, and their possible exacerbation by concurrent chronic conditions such as obesity.","Moving forward, larger patient cohorts are needed to fully validate the results. Another avenue for future research is to explore whether the testicular cells of older, heavy-set males show unique aging signatures, or whether they simply display accelerated aging. It is also not clear whether diet, exercise, diabetes, or altered hormone production play a role in testis aging. In addition, determining at what age the dysregulation of supporting testis cells emerges, and whether and how it may be reversible, may lead to improved medical guidance for older men.","\"Our study reveals potential biomarkers for diagnosis of testis aging and directions for potential treatment of aging-related subfertility,\" says Guo. \"It also serves as a foundational dataset for the scientific community to study how human testis and fertility respond to aging.\""],"image":["https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1474293507615-951863a0f942?ixid=MnwzMTg0OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw2fHxPbGRlciUyMG1lbnxlbnwwfDB8fHwxNjUxNTU4Mjcw&ixlib=rb-1.2.1"],"title":"Older men with high body-mass index have more sperm cell irregularities","description":"Single-cell analysis of autopsied human testes suggests that abnormalities associated with aging sperm cells might be exacerbated by elevated body mass index (BMI).","publish":{"$date":"2022-05-02T16:04:32Z"},"createdAt":{"$date":"2022-05-06T12:58:34.219Z"},"updatedAt":{"$date":"2022-05-06T12:58:34.219Z"},"__v":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"6270c7ad9d6c21966db7ee0d"},"authors":["David Hao, Sarah Low, Raffaele Di Fenza, Erica S.

Here, we further investigate GPR151 with the Pakistan Genome Resource (PGR), which is one of the largest exome biobanks of human homozygous loss-of-function carriers (knockouts) in the world. Among PGR participants, we identify eleven GPR151 putative loss-of-function (plof) variants, three of which are present at homozygosity (Arg95Ter, Tyr99Ter, and Phe175LeufsTer7), with a cumulative allele frequency of 2.2%. We confirm these alleles in vitro as loss-of-function.","We test if GPR151 plof is associated with BMI, T2D, or other metabolic traits and find that GPR151 deficiency in complete human knockouts is not associated with clinically significant differences in these traits. Relative to Gpr151+/+ mice, Gpr151-/- animals exhibit no difference in body weight on normal chow and higher body weight on a high-fat diet. Together, our findings indicate that GPR151 antagonism is not a compelling therapeutic approach to treatment of obesity.","Human genetics studies can provide compelling targets for therapeutic intervention. While some therapeutic targets, such as PCSK9, are based on extensive genetic validation, many others are based on weaker associations with variants of unknown consequence that require further validation.","Recent publications reported associations between loss of GPR151 function and low body mass index (BMI), raising the possibility of inhibiting GPR151 for the treatment of obesity and metabolic syndromes. To evaluate the relationship between GPR151 and BMI, we (1) identified and experimentally confirmed loss-of-function variants present in the Pakistan Genome Resource (PGR) biobank, one of the world’s largest biobanks of human gene “knockouts”, (2) analyzed these loss-of-function variants individually and in burden tests for association with BMI and other metabolic traits or diseases, and (3) verified the evolutionary conservation of our findings in mice lacking Gpr151.

Fewer than 40% of those diagnosed with ovarian cancer are cured, and about 12,810 people in the U.S. die from the disease every year.","For the last 25 years, scientists have tried to identify a screening test to detect ovarian cancer in its earliest stages, when the chance of cure is high. Unfortunately, multiple clinical trials with hundreds of thousands of participants have failed to identify an effective way to screen for ovarian cancer. In fact, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force gave ovarian cancer screening a grade of D in 2018, meaning it recommends against periodic screening because it doesn’t improve survival and can prove harmful to patients.","So 70% of people with ovarian cancer are diagnosed at advanced stages, when chances of cure are poor.","But even those with advanced disease have a higher chance of being cured if complete surgical removal is still possible. This makes early diagnosis all the more important for overall survival.","Without screening tests, many physicians wrongly assume that early diagnosis for ovarian cancer isn’t possible. As a gynecologic oncologist who treats hundreds of ovarian cancer patients each year, I was frustrated by these late diagnoses, and wondered whether better recognition of its symptoms could help clinicians and patients identify ovarian cancer earlier."],"image":["https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1583912086096-8c60d75a53f9?ixid=MnwzMTg0OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw1fHxPdmFyaWFuJTIwY2FuY2VyfGVufDB8MHx8fDE2NTE4NDE5MTY&ixlib=rb-1.2.1"],"createdAt":{"$date":"2022-05-06T13:04:15.892Z"},"updatedAt":{"$date":"2022-05-06T13:04:15.892Z"},"__v":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"62751ccfe31659b104dff5f5"},"title":"Four in five women not confident on ovarian cancer symptoms","authors":["Dublin Gazette"],"description":"New research has highlighted that four out of five women, 79 per cent, in Ireland are not confident that they would notice a symptom of ovarian cancer, the Irish Network for Gynaecological Oncology has reported.","publish":{"$date":"2022-05-05T12:58:35Z"},"content":["New research has highlighted that four out of five women, 79 per cent, in Ireland are not confident that they would notice a symptom of ovarian cancer, the Irish Network for Gynaecological Oncology has reported.","Ireland has one of the highest death rates from ovarian cancer in Europe, with approximately 400 women diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year in Ireland and almost 300 women dying from this cancer annually.

","This is evident in the statistics, as 83 per cent of patients diagnosed with stage one ovarian cancer are alive five years after diagnosis. This is a stark difference when compared with patients diagnosed with stage four ovarian cancer, just 16 per cent of whom are alive five years after diagnosis.","The INGO’s campaign centres around the BEAT symptoms: Bloating that is persistent and doesn’t come and go; Eating less and feeling full more quickly; Abdominal and pelvic pain you feel most days; Toilet changes in urination or bowel habits.

Research has found that younger women are more likely to experience delays in diagnosis.","In New Zealand, one in eight women are diagnosed under the age of 45. In women aged 20-44 years it remains the 5th most common cause of cancer death.","Cervical smears do not detect ovarian cancer. The two main tests for ovarian cancer are a CA-125 blood test and an ultrasound. CA-125 is often the first test but it’s more likely to be normal in younger women. However, in several regions of the country women are unable to access ultrasounds if their CA-125 blood test is normal.","Cure Our Ovarian Cancer founder Jane Ludemann says “this is really concerning. In contrast to better researched types of cancer, the survival of most types of ovarian cancer is poor unless it’s found at stage 1 (when the cancer is contained within the ovaries). That’s an incredibly narrow window for early detection.”","Cure Our Ovarian Cancer submitted Official Information Act requests to District Health Boards (DHBs) to assess ultrasound wait times for women with ovarian cancer symptoms. Of the thirteen DHBs that responded, of women with a normal CA-125 result, only seven would accept a referral for someone younger than 45 with one month of symptoms. While two (Hawkes Bay and Northland) indicated they would not accept the referral even if symptoms lasted three months and were progressive.
